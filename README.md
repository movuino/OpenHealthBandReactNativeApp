# OpenHealthBandReactNativeApp

React Native App for the Open Health Band

### Requirements

* Follow the [environment setup steps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). I use React Native CLI on mac OSX for this project, and only built Android versions so far.
* Clone this repository with the `--recursive` option to include the `react-native-polar-ble-sdk` plugin (it is not included as an npm module yet, as it is easier to commit changes to the submodule directly during development and keep its repository up to date than to use npm link which doesn't seem to work properly).
* run `npm install`
